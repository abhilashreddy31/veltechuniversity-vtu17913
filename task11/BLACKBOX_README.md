This is a simple Express server that serves a single endpoint, `/numbers`. This endpoint accepts a query parameter `url`, which is a list of URLs that point to files containing numbers. The server will fetch the numbers from each file and return them in a JSON object, sorted in ascending order.

The server is implemented using the following Express middleware:

* `app.get('/numbers', async (req, res) => {}`: This middleware handles the `/numbers` endpoint. It first gets the `url` query parameter from the request object and filters it to remove any invalid URLs. It then creates a promise for each valid URL and calls the `fetchNumbers` function to fetch the numbers from the file. The `fetchNumbers` function is explained in more detail below.
* `Promise.allSettled(promises)`: This function waits for all of the promises to resolve or reject. If any of the promises reject, the `Promise.allSettled` function will reject with the first rejected promise.
* `res.json({ numbers: sortedNumbers })`: This function sends a JSON response to the client. The response object contains a `numbers` property that is an array of the numbers that were fetched from the files.

The `fetchNumbers` function is responsible for fetching the numbers from a file. It does this by first creating a `URL` object from the file URL. It then uses the `axios` library to make a GET request to the file. If the request is successful, the `fetchNumbers` function returns the numbers that were found in the file. If the request fails, the `fetchNumbers` function returns an empty array.

The server is started by calling the `app.listen` function. This function listens for HTTP requests on port 4000.

Here is an example of how to use the server:

```
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:4000/numbers?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/numbers/master/numbers.txt'
```

This will return a JSON response with an array of numbers that were found in the `numbers.txt` file.
